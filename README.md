# What is this?

MHWI-Mumble is a plugin for Monster Hunter Wilds that enables positional audio, so now you can hunt with friends but with the added immersion of spatial audio!

# Requirements
[REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework)<br>
[Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/)

A friend tech savy enough to host a mumble server, or a public server!

(Everyone who intends to speak positionally requires this mod.)

# How to set up
1. Install REFramework on your monster hunter wilds installation.
2. Download the latest dll in the releases tab, or compile it from source.
3. Drop the dll into \Steam\steamapps\common\MonsterHunterWilds\reframework\plugins\
4. In mumble's settings, go to <strong>Positional Audio</strong> and enable it along with the headphones setting.
5. Set up the minimum and maximum distance in the <strong>Positional Audio</strong> as well as the bloom.<br>

Personally I like the following values:

<strong>
Minimum Distance: 0<br>
Maximum Distance: 80<br>
Minimum Volume: 0<br>
Bloom: 25%<br><br>
</strong>

6. Go to <strong>Plugins</strong> and enable Link to Game and Transmit Position
7. In the list of plugins enable the <strong>Link</strong> plugin
8. Launch monster hunter wilds (with mumble already opened) and wait for the opening sequence. <strong>If its working you will get a message in the mumble chat sidebar saying that it has linked.</strong>

<strong>MAKE SURE YOU HIT APPLY!!!</strong>

With all that done, you will be able to hear your friends from where they are positioned on the map, this works regardless of if they are in the same link party and environment link.
